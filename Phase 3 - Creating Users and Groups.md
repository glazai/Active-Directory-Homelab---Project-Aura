It is time to add new Users and Groups.

We will begin by adding a User manually just to showcase how it is done.

The new User will join the IT department and the steps are as followed:

1. RightClick on IT OU -> "New" -> "User"
2. Fill in user information
3. Set Password, Make sure to check "User must change password at next logon"
4. Finish

Following the above steps we should see something like this:
